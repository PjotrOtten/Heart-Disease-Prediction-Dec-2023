# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project is to predict whether a person has a cardiovascular Disease or not.
The data used for this project has been obtained from an open-source dataset from kaggle named Heart Failure Prediction Dataset (Fedesoriano, 2021).
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data

Quoted from (Fedesoriano, 2021): This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

Cleveland: 303 observations
Hungarian: 294 observations
Switzerland: 123 observations
Long Beach VA: 200 observations
Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

Total: 1190 observations
Duplicated: 272 observations

Final dataset: 918 observations

Every dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
